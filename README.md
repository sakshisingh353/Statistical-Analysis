# Statistical-Analysis
A physician is evaluating a new diet for her patients with a family history of
heart disease. To test the effectiveness of this diet, 16 patients are placed on the
diet for 6 months. Their weights and triglyceride levels are measured before
and after the study, and the physician wants to know if either set of
measurements has changed.
